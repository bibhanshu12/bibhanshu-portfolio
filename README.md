# 🌐 Bibhanshu Lal Karn — Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building scalable and impactful web applications.

## 👋 About Me

Hi there, let me tell you a bit about who I am.  
I’m a highly motivated software engineer with a passion for web development and a solid foundation in backend engineering.

I like to call myself a man full of ambition. I genuinely enjoy debugging code — sure, it can feel like a headache sometimes, but I treat it like a game where only two things matter: **win or quit**… and boom — **win-win!**

In my free time, I love watching animated movies and occasionally diving into anime as well — it's one of my favorite ways to unwind and get inspired.

🥷🌀👊 **And yep, that’s a little about me!**
